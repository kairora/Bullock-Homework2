2nd Homework Assignment: Responsive Portfolio

This assignment is the starting build of my own portfolio. It has three pages: About, Portfolio, and Contact.  There is a working navbar and links out to my projects so far either directly or via my github repositories. 

The images are responsive and the site has been validated.
